excitement out of it. This program removes the tough part out of it.

tickets. The user at the beginning is displayed with booking options.

the movie as per details that are displayed. Then the user is displayed with the
choices of seating along with its price. The user is then asked to enter the number
of seats and the position of the seats. Once the user has entered his/her choice
the user is requested to enter certain details like name, phone number and email id.
Then the user is displayed with the bill.
